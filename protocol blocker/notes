fixed window rate limiting

to add:
traffic shaping on the basis of ports and ips.

maintain a map that will have either 0 or 1. if 0, enable fixed window rate limiting, if 1 then enable the algorithm of traffic shaping.
first add num!=0 && num!=1 in the map. like say.. 2, to disable all limiting features.

enable spinlocks in fixed window rate limiting

modify traffic shaping to packets. like this much packets per ip
